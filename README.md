# This is a React Js project for practise purpose with each files consisting of following coding challenges.

1. Dynamic Table with Sorting and Pagination
Create a table component in React that dynamically populates with data from an API. Add features for sorting by columns and pagination. Ensure that it performs efficiently with large datasets.
2. Form with Validation and Dynamic Fields
Build a form that has multiple input fields, including dynamic fields that appear based on the user's selection. Implement validation and display error messages where needed.
3. Complex State Management with Redux
Build a component that fetches and displays data from an API. Use Redux for state management and ensure that the data is cached and reused to avoid unnecessary re-fetching.
4. To-Do List with Editable Tasks and Filters
Create a To-Do list with React that supports adding, editing, deleting tasks, and filtering tasks by their status (complete, incomplete). Ensure state persists on page refresh.
5. User Profile Component with Optimistic UI Updates
Design a user profile component where the user can update their profile information. Implement optimistic UI updates, meaning the UI updates immediately while the changes are sent to the server in the background.
6. Nested Comments System
Build a nested comments component where users can reply to comments, and replies are displayed under the respective parent comment. Ensure that deep nesting is handled efficiently.
7. Image Gallery with Lazy Loading
Develop an image gallery component that displays a grid of images. Implement lazy loading to ensure only images within the viewport are loaded, and prefetch images as the user scrolls.
8. Drag and Drop Kanban Board
Create a Kanban board component with draggable tasks. The tasks can be moved between different columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done"). Use React DnD or another drag-and-drop library.
9. Modal with Portal and Accessibility Features
Build a modal component using React Portal for rendering the modal outside of the DOM hierarchy. Ensure accessibility by managing focus traps and keyboard navigation.
10. Responsive Navbar with Dropdown and Submenu
Create a responsive navigation bar that includes dropdowns and nested submenus. Ensure the menu behaves appropriately across different screen sizes.
11. Data Visualization with Charts
Build a component that takes in an array of data points and visualizes it using charts (e.g., bar chart, line chart). You can use a library like Chart.js or D3.js to achieve this.
12. Real-Time Search with Debouncing
Develop a search bar that allows users to search through a dataset. Implement debouncing to minimize the number of API calls while the user types.
13. Infinite Scroll List
Implement an infinite scrolling list where more data is loaded as the user scrolls down. Ensure performance optimizations to handle large datasets without freezing the UI.
14. Chat Application with WebSockets
Build a simple chat interface where users can send and receive messages in real-time. Implement WebSockets to enable real-time communication between users.
15. E-commerce Product Filtering System
Create a product listing page for an e-commerce site with multiple filters (price, category, rating, etc.). The products should be dynamically filtered based on the userâ€™s selections.
16. Context API for Theme Management
Build a component that uses the Context API to manage the global theme (light mode/dark mode) for the application. The theme should persist across page reloads.
17. File Upload with Progress Bar
Implement a file upload component where users can upload files to a server. Show a progress bar indicating the percentage of file upload completion.
18. Collaborative Text Editor
Build a text editor component where multiple users can collaborate in real-time. Ensure that changes made by one user are immediately reflected to others. Use WebSockets for real-time updates.
19. Accordion Component with Animation
Create an accordion component where sections can be expanded/collapsed with smooth animations. Only one section should be open at a time.
20. Optimized Data Fetching with useMemo and useCallback
Build a component that fetches data from an API and displays it. Use useMemo and useCallback hooks to optimize performance, ensuring the component does not re-fetch or re-render unnecessarily.
